# Nesta Group Policy Alignment (Project Documentation)

This repository documents how the Nesta Evidently Bot aligns with Nesta Group policies. All staff, contractors, and contributors must follow these requirements when using, operating, or developing this project.

## 1) Generative AI Policy (Nesta Group)

* **Default tool:** Google Gemini is the approved GenAI tool for business use.
* **Exceptions require approval:** Use of non-Gemini GenAI tools is only permitted with approval from your line manager and the Technology team.
* **No sensitive input to unapproved tools:** Personal data and confidential information must not be entered into unapproved GenAI tools.
* **Responsible use:** Document risk assessments, check contractual requirements, be transparent about GenAI use, and ensure human review/judgment.
* **DPIA required for personal data:** If Gemini processes personal data, complete a DPIA before use.
* **Policy updates:** Review the latest policy regularly as it may change.

Questions about this policy should be directed to the Applied Research & Innovation Director.

## 2) Data Protection Policy (Nesta Group)

## 5) Software Development & Coding Standards (Nesta Group)

* **Secure coding:** Follow industry standards (e.g., OWASP, CERT) and Nesta/BIT SDLC requirements.
* **Code review & testing:** Perform peer review and security testing before release.
* **Data protection in code:** Mask or obfuscate sensitive data where required and avoid sensitive logging.
